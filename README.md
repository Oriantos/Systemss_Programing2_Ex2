## About The Assignment
In this project we were asked about squared matrixes.
The purpose was to practice the use of operators in CPP.
The project includes an implementation of a class representin squared matrix, and many operators in it.
There was no use in the standard library for any type of data structure - only for exceptions and O/I operations.
